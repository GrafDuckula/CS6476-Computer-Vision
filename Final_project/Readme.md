1. Download format 2 dataset of SVHN and cifar10 dataset into folder “data”.

2. Previously trained model 3 (my model) is stored in folder “model”.

3. After run run.py, five images will be generated and saved in folder output.


- if you want to train VGG16, run all cells in VGG16_Train.ipynb, and switch pretrained = False or True in cell 5 of VGG16_Train.ipynb accordingly. 

- if you want to train my model, run all cells in MyModel_Train.ipynb.

- To generate video, run all cells in Detection_on_video.ipynb
